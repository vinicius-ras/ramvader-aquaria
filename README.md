# RAMvader-Aquaria
RAMvader-Aquaria is an opensource trainer for the game Aquaria. It has been developed using C# (WPF for user interface, p/Invoke to make calls to lower-level Windows APIs) and some Assembly instructions.

RAMvader-Aquaria uses the RAMvader library to have access to most low-level trainer functionality, such as performing reading and writing operations in the game's memory space. RAMvader-Aquaria is actually a project created to showcase the power and ease of use of the RAMvader library.
